### Clustering and visualization of ecological structure in species assemblages

This package contains functions for fitting [STRUCTURE](http://www.genetics.org/content/155/2/945) type models to ecological data, both at local and global geographic scales, together with GIS based visualizations of the fitted models. These *grade-of-membership* models can be used to assess the local representation of large regional biotas, their degree of intermixing in local assemblages, and their rate of turnover across geographic space owing to environmental or climatic turnover. ecostructure makes use of advances in clustering alrogrithms, first from the package CountClust in 1.0 and now leveraging its successor fastTopics in 2.0.

### Installation

Install **ecostructure** following the instructions below.

```R
install.packages(devtools)
install.packages("sf")
devtools::install_github("kkdey/methClust")
devtools::install_github("kkdey/maptpx"). # this is an updated version of CRAN package maptpx
devtools::install_github("kkdey/CountClust")
devtools::install_github("sidatsciencelab/ecostructure")
```
**ecostructure** requires access to the "gfortran" library. Mac OS X
users may encounter the error "library not found for -lgfortran" when
installing. To fix this error, please follow the instructions at this
[link](https://thecoatlessprofessor.com/programming/rcpp-rcpparmadillo-and-os-x-mavericks--lgfortran-and--lquadmath-error/). Apple Silicon users should instead follow the directions found [here](https://github.com/bioinfoDZ/RISC/issues/10). 

Then load **ecostructure**

```R
library(ecostructure)
```

- [Alex White](https://sidatasciencelab.github.io/)
- [Kushal K Dey](https://www.deylab.net/)

This package grew out of a collaboration between Kushal Dey and Alex White while they were graduate students at the University of Chicago. Their advisors played a large role in developing these methods: 

- [Matthew Stephens](http://stephenslab.uchicago.edu/)
- [Trevor Price](https://pondside.uchicago.edu/ecol-evol/people/price.html)

### Questions?

For any queries or concerns related to the software, you can open an issue [here](https://github.com/sidatasciencelab/ecostructure/issues). 

The methods used to develop this framework have advanced since our initial release and may yet evolve in future iterations of this package. The Smithsonian Data Science Lab continues to collaborate with the Dey Lab (Sloan Kettering), the Price Lab (U Chicago) and the Stephens Lab (U Chicago) to develop this work.
