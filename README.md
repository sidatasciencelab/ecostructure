# ecostructure
### An R package for clustering and visualization of structure in ecological data

This package contains functions for fitting [STRUCTURE](http://www.genetics.org/content/155/2/945) type models to ecological data, both at local and global geographic scales, together with GIS based visualizations of the fitted models. These *grade-of-membership* models can be used to assess the local representation of large regional biotas, their degree of intermixing in local assemblages, and their rate of turnover across geographic space owing to environmental or climatic turnover. ecostructure makes use of advances in clustering alrogrithms, first from the package CountClust in 1.0 and now leveraging its successor fastTopics in 2.0.

- [Alex White](https://sidatasciencelab.github.io/)
- [Kushal K Dey](https://www.deylab.net/)

This package grew out of a collaboration between Kushal Dey and Alex White while they were graduate students at the University of Chicago. Their advisors played a large role in developing these methods: 

- [Matthew Stephens](http://stephenslab.uchicago.edu/)
- [Trevor Price](https://pondside.uchicago.edu/ecol-evol/people/price.html)
