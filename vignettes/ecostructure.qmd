# Introduction

**ecostructure** is an R package for clustering and visualizing structure in ecological assemblages using Mixed Membership or Grade of Membership (GoM) models (see [reference](https://www.stat.washington.edu/sites/default/files/files/reports/2006/tr492.pdf): -@erosheva2006latent). The package will analyze ecological census data of many kinds - your data may reflect anything from species abundances in local communities (e.g., classical community ecology; -@white2019regional) to the presence and absence of species across continents (e.g., macroecology and biogeography; -@white2019regional,@white2021dispersal,@li2021grade,@rana2022key).

To parse biological structure in the data beyond mere species lists, **ecostructure** allows phylogenetic, geographic, and morphological data to be incorporated in the clustering framework, producing clusters that account for the similarity of species and therefore allow comparisons of structure according to variation along different axes of diversity. In this framework, we call the clusters *motifs*.

This tutorial focuses on an analysis of bird species assemblages across the globe and how those assemblages converge locally in communities in the Himalayas (-@white2019regional). We showcase the use of the **ecostructure** to assess the turnover of species across assemblages and communities, and we illustrate that turnover with visualizations.

The main contributions of the **ecostructure** package are as follows:

-   Functions to cluster species abundance and species presence/absence data by fitting GoM models.

-   New methods for visualizing the structure of species assemblages (e.g., communities or continental biotas), leveraging the output from the appropriate GoM model.

-   Tools to process species level data using a phylogeny, a trait dataset, or a GIS dataset in order to examine the contribution of phylogenetic history, function, and geography to the species level structure.

The analytical framework provided by **ecostructure** was first employed in our accompanying 2019 paper (-@white2019regional). That analysis leverages a census of bird species abundances at 38 local sites across the elevations in the eastern and western Himalaya. We provide those data as part of this package.

# Installation

## System requirements

**ecostructure** requires core geospatial libraries supporting the use of GIS data in R - GDAL ($>= 2.0.1$), GEOS ($>= 3.4.0$), and PROJ.4 ($>= 4.8.0$). Typically these libraries get automatically installed as part of the dependency packages to **ecostructure**.

**ecostructure** requires access to the "gfortran" library. Mac OS X users may encounter the error "library not found for -lgfortran" when installing. To fix this error, please follow the instructions at this [link](https://thecoatlessprofessor.com/programming/rcpp-rcpparmadillo-and-os-x-mavericks--lgfortran-and--lquadmath-error/). Apple Silicon users should instead follow the directions found [here](https://github.com/bioinfoDZ/RISC/issues/10). 

## R requirements

**ecostructure** requires R version $>= 3.4.0$

To install **ecostructure**, first install the package dependencies.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
install.packages(devtools)
install.packages("sf")
devtools::install_github("kkdey/methClust")
devtools::install_github("kkdey/maptpx") # this is an updated version of CRAN package maptpx
devtools::install_github("kkdey/CountClust")
devtools::install_github("sidatsciencelab/ecostructure")
```

Then load **ecostructure**

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ecostructure)
set.seed(1)
```

A comprehensive list of all the functions in the **ecostructure** package can be found by running the following command.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
help(package = "ecostructure")
```

# Himalayan Bird Surveys

We present the abundances of birds in 38 five ha forest patches across elevations in both the eastern and western Himalayas, together with site metadata. There are 304 species in the dataset, and species morphological measurements (species means) are also presented along with a time-calibrated phylogeny representing evolutionary relationships of those species. For detailed methods related to measuring traits and building the phylogeny, see -@white2019regional).

The *species abundances* are saved as a matrix object and can be read as follows:

```{r}
data("him_birds_cn")
species_counts <- him_birds_cn
species_counts[1:10,1:5]
```

The *site metadata* for the Himalayan sites - describing elevation, east/west, latitude, and longitude - is a `data.frame` object and can be read as follows:

```{r}
data("him_grids_md")
site_metadata <- him_grids_md
head(site_metadata)
```

Finally, the *species metadata*, comprising the means of the bill morphology, wing size, tarsus and mass of each species, can be read as follows:

```{r}
data("him_birds_md")
species_metadata <- him_birds_md
head(species_metadata)
```

Besides the survey data, **ecostructure** also provides a presence absence matrix for all breeding birds in southeast Asia, encompassing the region of the survey sites in the above data. This data has been prepared from publicly available shapefiles (.shp) from [BirdLife International](http://www.birdlife.org/).

```{r}
data("indian_birds_pa")
```

# Model fitting and Visualizations

The `ecos_fit` function fits the Grade of Membership model. The first version of this function took advantage of the package `CountClust` (-@key2017viz) to fit the model. We have replaced this functionality with `CountClust`'s successor `fastTopics`(-@carbonetto2021nnmf). As before, we can fit models either on binary presence-absence data or species abundance counts data, but with `fastTopics` we can now fit models much faster. We illustrate each case below. 

## Species abundance data

We use `ecos_fit` to evaluate structure in the Himalayan birds dataset. These data are counts of species in sites, and so the function fits a Multinomial model to generate *species abundance motifs*. The data structure (abundance or presence/absence) is evaluated by the function automatically.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
fit <- ecos_fit(species_counts, K = 2)
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
fit <- ecos_fit_dev(species_counts, K = 2, sparse = T,
                    num_iter_main = 1000, 
                    num_iter_refine = 1000)
```

The function outputs a lower rank representation of the data in `species_counts`, according to the value of K chosen by the user. Above, we chose to examine the primary partition of the data into 2 motifs by setting `K` = 2. The method in `fastTopics` takes advantage of a two step model fit, and `num_iter_main` and `num_inte_refine` can each be modified to control the length of time the underlying algorithm will run before convergence during each step. These may need to be modified if the input data matrix is large. The input data matrix can be transformed to a `sparse.matrix` object if `sparse == T` - this is useful if the matrix contains mostly 0 abundances/absences and compute times are burdensome.  

The main components of the output from `ecos_fit` are:

-   `omega` : A site $\times$ K matrix, K representing the number of clusters or species abundance motifs. The row sums equal 1 and the entries are positive. These represent the contribution of the different motifs to the composition (i.e., species abundance distribution) of each site.

-   `theta` : A species $\times$ K matrix, where the column sums equal 1. These values represent the contributions of each species to each motif k.

### Vizualing motif contributions to sites

We can take the output from the model fit and visualize the motif contributions matrix `omega` using a stacked bar chart.

```{r fig.height=5, fig.width= 6, fig.align='center'}
east_west_dir <- factor(site_metadata$WorE, levels = c("W", "E"))
elevation_metadata <- site_metadata$Elevation
ecos_blocks(fit$omega,
  blocker_metadata = east_west_dir,
  order_metadata = elevation_metadata
)
```

Because we are interested in species turnover across elevational and geographic locations, we block the two elevational gradients (western or eastern) and plot them side by side.

This blocking structure (`blocker_metadata`) can be used for any environmental gradient of interest, allowing replicates or experimental treatments (in our case, geographic location) to be easily visualized together. `order_metadata` determines the order of the stacked bars in each block. Other parameters can be customized to modify the axes, titles, etc.

See `ecos_plot_pie` below to plot the data in a spatially explicit context (i.e., on a map).

### Identifying species contributions to motifs

A central component of this framework is assessing the species contributions to each motif. One may be tempted to merely examine the `theta` matrix component of the model fit, and identify the the species that differentially drive the clustering.

We use the function `ExtractTopFeatures`, supplied from the R package [CountClust](https://github.com/kkdey/CountClust/blob/master/R/ExtractTopFeatures.R), to compute and record the top contributing species to each species abundance motif.

```{r}
top_species <- ExtractTopFeatures(fit$theta, top_features = 5,
                                           method = "poisson", options = "max")
t(apply(top_species$indices, c(1,2), function(x) return(rownames(fit$theta)[x])))
```

### Comparing observed fit to null expectation

One may also want to compare the clustering of the original data to that of randomly generated null matrices of species abundances. We provide a way to compare the observed model fit to null model fits of various types. Randomized matrices of are generated internally using the `randomizeMatrix` function in the package [picante](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/picante/picante.pdf).

```{r}
out <- ecos_nullmodel(species_counts, K=2, null.model = "richness",
                              iter_randomized= 10, option = "BF")
```

## Presence-absence data

Here we describe how to cluster species using a presence-absence data matrix of species across the globe or sub-regions of the globe.

The matrix may represent be local data or macroecological data (species in a 1$^\circ$ $\times$ 1$^\circ$ map cell) - for functions to generate these data using GIS data sources (shapfiles or geodatabase files) see other sections below.

We again use `ecos_fit` to fit Grade of Membership models on binary presence-absence data using a Binomial/Bernoulli model. We refer to the clusters/motifs obtained by this procedure as *species motifs*.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
data("indian_birds_pa")
pres_ab_fit <- ecos_fit_dev(as.matrix(indian_birds_pa), K = 2)
```

Again, the function outputs a lower (specified by K) rank representation of the data `indian_birds_pa`. The output `pres_ab_fit` consists of `omega` and `theta` components and these matrices can be understood as:

-   `omega` : A site $\times$ K matrix, K representing the number of clusters or species motifs. The row sums equal 1 and the entries are positive. These represent the contribution of the different motifs to the species composition of each location.

-   `theta` : A species $\times$ K matrix, where each species has a probability of being found in the kth motif. These probabilities are *not* constrained to sum to 1 as in the multinomial case we illustrated earlier.

### Vizualing species motif contributions

We can take the output from the model fit and again visualize the membership proportions `omega`. However, as the data may consist of thousands of spatially explicit locations, we do not use `ecos_blocks` as in the previous example, but instead use the function `ecos_plot_pie`, which incorporates latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates of the original sites. We plot the `omega` matrix in a spatial context as follows.

```{r}
ecos_plot_pie(omega = pres_ab_fit$omega,
                      lat_lim = c(5,50),
                      long_lim = c(55,120),
                      path = "geostructure_plot.png")

```

This function will create a file `geostructure_plot.png` in the current folder (`getwd()` in R to examine where your .png file is saved).

![](geostructure_plot.png)

One can easily apply this to any region of interest. We provide an example of visualizing species presence-absence structure as generated by applying the binomial GoM model with $K=6$ on the bird species presence absence matrix from Australia. Again these data have been processed from [BirdLife International](http://datazone.birdlife.org/species/requestdis)

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
data("australia_birds")
australia_model <- ecos_fit_dev(as.matrix(australia_birds$pr_ab_data), K=6)
```

The results from this fit, which takes \< 2 minutes, are saved as `australia_model` and can be visualized as follows

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#data("australia_model")
ecos_plot_pie(omega = australia_model$omega,
              coords = australia_birds$latlong, 
              long_lim = c(110,160),
              lat_lim = c(-50,-10),
              path = "geostructure_plot_aus.png",
              color= c("orange", "red", "yellow", 
                       "deepskyblue", "chartreuse", 
                       "blue"))
```

The plot should look as follows

## Geographic contributions to local communities

**ecostructure** offers tools for users to examine how local patterns of community structure are related to potential geographic sources. One way to interpret the geographic inputs into a given site is to generate a site's dispersion field by overlapping the geographic distributions of the species present at the site.

### Generating dispersion fields for local sites

For a given dataset of local species presences (can be abundances but dispersion fields are generated based on presence), we can generate dispersion fields for each site and again fit a GoM model. These methods require some types of GIS data source, either shapefiles of species distributions, a geodatabase of species distributions (as in the .gdb of global bird species ditrbutions provided by BirdLife International), or even point occurences of species presences in a region.

We generate dispersion fields for our 38 sites using the function `dsp_create_from_survey`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

## If GIS data are in the form of separate shapefiles (.shp)

local_him_disp <- dsp_create_from_survey(local_data = species_counts,
                              gis_data_type = "shp",
                              shp_dir = {PATH TO directory with species shapefiles})

## If GIS data are in the form of a geodatabase (.gdb)

local_him_disp <- dsp_create_from_survey(local_data = species_counts,
                              gis_data_type = "gdb",
                              gdb_dir = {PATH To Directory with Species Geodatabase})
```

`dsp_create_from_survey` takes a local data matrix and a specified GIS data type to produce dispersion fields in a specified regions. The function reads in shapefiles for each species (or a .gdb for all species) and rasterizes those distributions for a given resolution. There are many arguments to customize so be sure to examine the documentation for this function. The output 'local_him_disp' consists of 3 objects.

-   `raster` : A list of rasters representing the dispersion fields for each site (length is the number of rows (sites) in `local data`) at the specified resolution.

-   `precise` : A list of rasters representing the dispersion fields for each site (length is the number of rows (sites) in `local data`) at the resolution of the argument `precise`. These could be used for plotting high resolution dispersion fields.

-   `matrix` : A list of the same rasters is `raster` but in matrix form. These are used for easily processing the dispersion fields into the structure required to fit a GoM model.

### Visualizing dispersion fields

We can generate maps for all of the disperison fields using the function `dsp_plot_map`. We provide the dispersion fields for our 38 Himalyan community surveys, `dispersion_field_ex`, as a list of matrices.

```{r}
data("dispersion_field_ex")
dsp_plots <- dsp_plot_map(dispersion_field_ex,
  raster_latlim = c(5, 50), 
  raster_longlim = c(50, 120),
  scale = "percentage"
)
dsp_plots[[1]]
```

`dsp_plots` is now a list of plots, each of which visualizes the dispersion fields from our local sites.

### Processing dispersion fields for GoM model fit

We can easily process the dispersion fields into one data matrix by using `dsp_to_matrix`

```{r}
dsp_fields_matrix <- dsp_to_matrix(dispersion_field_ex)
```

The output from `dsp_to_matrix` is a data matrix with rows equivalent to each site's dispersion field as a vector.

```{r}
dim(dsp_fields_matrix)
```

Each column is a map cell in the region of interest, with the value being a count from each site of how many species from that site overlap the cell.

### GoM model and visualization of dispersion fields

As these data are counts, we can now fit a multinomial GoM (using to examine *geographic motifs*. In this case, `omega` is a matrix of motif contributions to dispersion fields, and the `theta` matrix represents each map cells contrbution to each of the motifs. We can plot the `theta`s on a map, showing the contribution of each map cell to the motif. Some biologists may think of these motifs as analagous to the regional inputs into local communities.

The model fit is done using `ecos_fit` as above. Because this geographic data matrix may be particularly large, depending on the resolution chosen to produce the dispersion fields, the fit may take longer than the fit on the original data matrix.

```{r, eval = F}
#fit <- ecos_fit(dsp_fields_matrix, K = 2, tol = 0.1, num_trials = 10)
fit <- ecos_fit_dev(dsp_fields_matrix, K = 2, sparse = F,
                    num_iter_main = 100, 
                    num_iter_refine = 100)
```

We can plot the theta distributions of each geographical motif using the function `dsp_motif`. We provide an example theta matrix with the package called `example_theta`.

```{r}
#data("example_theta")
himalayan_geo_motifs <- dsp_motif(fit$theta, 
                                  color_ramp = c("black", "darkseagreen3",
                                                 "orange","red"),
                                  dsp_fld_res = 8)
himalayan_geo_motifs$motif_maps[[1]]
```

We call this color palette the *Ghostbusters theme* !! :)

## Incorporating phylogenic and trait information

The relationships between species, either phylogenetically or functionally, are an important component in evaluating ecological structure. We provide two functions, one for phylogenies and one for trait data, that collapse species into either clades or functional groups based on a desired cut off.

### Phylogeny

We load the time-calibrated phylogenetic tree `phylo_tree` of the 304 Himalayan birds in `species_counts`. We then collapse the species into clades to based on certain time point cut off on the tree `collapse_at`. Below we cut the tree off at 10 million years ago.

```{r}
data("phylo_tree")
phylo_counts <- ecos_prepare_by_phylo(species_counts, phylo_tree, collapse_at = 10)
dim(phylo_counts$outdat)
```

### Traits

We use morphological trait metadata from `himalayan_birds` data and then use the distance metric based on these traits to collapse the bird species as above. As in the case of the time component above, one can set `prop_div` to a collapse the tips of trait dendrogram to produce a specific number of functional groups (the proportion of the original diversity). Below we create $91$ functional groups out of the original 304 species.

```{r}
bill_traits <- as.matrix(dist(scale(species_metadata[,c(1:3)])))
counts_bill_traits <- ecos_prepare_by_trait(counts = species_counts, 
                                                    traits = bill_traits, 
                                                    prop_div=0.3)
dim(counts_bill_traits)
```

Both `phylo_counts` and `counts_bill_traits` can now be passed to `ecos_fit` to generate either *phylogenetic motifs* or *trait motifs*.

## Generating a presence absence matrix

There are a number of ways to generate species presence absence data to evaluate *species motifs*. Conservation organizations ([IUCN](http://www.iucnredlist.org/technical-documents/spatial-data), [BirdLife International](http://datazone.birdlife.org/species/requestdis), etc.) often distribute shapefiles and geodatabase that contain geographic distributions in the form of polygons. Point occurances can also be overlaid on a raster to produce a rough geographic distribution (this may be suitable for fitting GoMs at a large scale).

We provide a function `dsp_create_from_gdb` that creates a presence absence matrix using these GIS data types. This function is slow on large datasets. We illustrate how it might be used below on the geodatabase of global bird distrbutions provided by BirdLife International.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

## Request and fetch geodatabase (gdb) from BirdLife International : http://datazone.birdlife.org/species/requestdis or 

## say we call one such gdb - example_birdlife.gdb

gdb_global_birds <- st_read("example_birdlife.gdb")

## Then run the following commands to generate the presence absence matrix

disp_from_scratch <- dsp_create_from_gdb(gdb_object = gdb_global_birds,
                      raster_resolution = 1,thresh = 3,
                      raster_latlim = c(-90,90),
                      raster_longlim = c(-180,180),
                      species_feature = "SCINAME")
```

The presence absence data is output as `disp_from_scratch$pres_ab` on which `ecos_fit` can be run.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
fit <- ecos_fit(disp_from_scratch$pres_ab, K = 5, 
                        tol = 0.1, num_trials = 10)
```

`dsp_create_from_gdb` also returns the dispersion fields similar to dispersion fields create.

One may request the BirdLife dataset from [here](http://datazone.birdlife.org/species/requestdis). Presence/absence data illustrated above was generated using this data source.

Users may also look to other packages that specifically focus on generating presence absence data from GIS data types. [letsR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/letsR/letsR.pdf) is an incredibly useful package to this end. Presence-absence matrices from **letsR** can certainly be used in tandem with the **ecostructure** functions. Our goal is to contribute to that body of work by creating a tool that employs the speed and utility of the packages [sf](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/index.html) and [fasterize](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fasterize/index.html) (see [velox](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/velox/velox.pdf) as well).
