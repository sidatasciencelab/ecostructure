Description: Provides tools to visualize and analyze structure from a site-species
    abundance data using grade of membership models. Also provides functions to 
    generate global abundance dispersion fields and subsequent global abundance 
    count matrices from a local site-species abundance data and available 
    shapefiles. Additionally, has functions to view how grades of membership or 
    any feature of the site varies with the relative distance profile of the sites 
    and ordering of sites (by some metadata - say elevation).
