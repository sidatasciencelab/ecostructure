\title{Prepare counts data for trait-collapsed species}
\usage{
ecos_prepare_by_trait(counts, traits, prop_div = 0.3)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts}{The abundance counts matrix with samples/sites along the rows
and the species/features along the columns.}

\item{traits}{A distance metric between species - a square matrix with
species along rows and columns and the diagonal element equal to
0.}

\item{prop_div}{The proportion of the original counts matrix diversity at which
to cut the dendrogram.}
}
\value{
The output is a counts matrix with the columns corresponding to the
species bins - each bin designated here by the first species entry into the bin.
}
\description{
Starting from a taxonomic species abundance matrix, produces
a new matrix, with features now collapsed versions of the species where the
collapsing is done by trait level information. Binning is done on the species
based on their trait level similarity- where similarity is determined by
a dendogram produced by hierarchical clustering.

\examples{

data(himalayan_birds)
species_metadata <- pData(featureData(himalayan_birds))
taxonomic_counts <- t(exprs(himalayan_birds))
bill_traits <- as.matrix(dist(scale(species_metadata[,c(1:3)])))
counts_bill_traits <- ecos_prepare_by_trait(counts = taxonomic_counts, 
                                            traits = bill_traits, 
                                            prop_div=0.3)
