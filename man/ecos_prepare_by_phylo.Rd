\title{Prepare counts data for phylogenetically collapsed species}
\usage{
ecos_prepare_by_phylo(dat, tree, collapse_at)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{The phylogenetic tree structure on the species or the
column features of the counts matrix. Should be of the form
\code{.tre}.}

\item{collapse_at}{The point on the tree at which to collapse the tree}

\item{counts}{The abundance counts matrix with samples/sites along the rows
and the species/features along the columns.}
}
\value{
Returns a counts matrix with the features being the
phylogenetically collapsed species from the original data based on the
tree structure.
}
\description{
Starting from a taxonomic species abundance matrix, produces
a new matrix, with features now collpased vesions of the species where the
collapsing is done by a phylogenetic tree structure.
